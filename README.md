# KGDS
**Knowledge-Grounded Discussion Summarization (KGDS)** is a novel task designed to produce a **supplementary background summary** and a **clear opinion summary** by integrating shared background knowledge with the discussion content. The goal is to create reader-centered summaries by bridging knowledge gaps with necessary background-supporting information and presenting clear participant opinions with clarified implicit references.

## üìä Benchmark Dataset
The official dataset is available at `benchmark/KGDS.json`. The file contains a list of JSON objects, where each object has the following fields:
* `SBK`: **S**hared **B**ackground **K**nowledge (news domain).
* `KGD`: **K**nowledge-**G**rounded **D**iscussion.
* `BSP`: **B**ackground-**S**upporting **P**aragraphs.
* `CAO`: **C**lear **A**tomic **O**pinions.
* `BSPAF`: **B**ackground-**S**upporting **P**aragraph **A**tomic **F**acts. Those annotated with `"type": 1` are **Key Background-Supporting Atomic Facts**.
* `BNPAF`: **B**ackground-**N**onsupporting **P**aragraph **A**tomic **F**acts. Those labeled with `"type": 0` are **Background-Nonsupporting Atomic Facts**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Evaluation Framework
Our evaluation framework provides a comprehensive and hierarchical assessment of the generated summaries. It independently evaluates the sub-summaries (background and opinion) using fine-grained, interpretable metrics and then aggregates these scores to determine the overall quality at the paradigm level.
